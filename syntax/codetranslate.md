# The code blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used to write to programming or to highlight a code source. More than a simple pragma, the lines of code of a block of code are literally interpreted.

Here is an example:

......
This is a block of code
......

In order to create a block of code online, simply identify each row of the block with less than 4 spaces or a table.

For example :

......
This is a normal paragraph:

This is a block of code.
......

You can also create a separate code block with:

......

### Online code block

Online blocks of code can be written using:

For example:

This is an online block of code

### The syntax for highlighting

You can define the language used to highlight the syntax by adding a name to an opening keyword. Example:

Js
Var a = {};
......
